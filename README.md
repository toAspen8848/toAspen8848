# AI Developer | LLM Systems, Automation, RAG

I design and build **production-grade AI systems** that solve real business problems.  
My work focuses on **LLM-based applications**, **AI-driven automation**, and **scalable backend architecture**.

I specialize in taking ideas from **prototype to deployment**, with a strong emphasis on **reliability, cost-efficiency, and maintainability**.

---

## Core Focus

- LLM application design (RAG, agents, evaluation pipelines)
- AI-powered automation and workflow systems
- End-to-end AI product development
- Backend architecture for AI services
- MLOps, monitoring, and deployment

---

## Tech Stack

**AI / ML**
- OpenAI APIs, Hugging Face, LangChain, LlamaIndex

**Backend**
- Python, Node.js, FastAPI

**Data**
- PostgreSQL, Vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone-like architectures)

**Infrastructure**
- AWS, Docker, CI/CD

---

## What I Value in AI Development

- Clear problem definition before model choice
- Data quality over model hype
- Measurable evaluation, not subjective demos
- Systems that are maintainable by teams, not individuals
- Honest estimates and realistic trade-offs

---

## Selected Work

Pinned repositories on this profile demonstrate:

- Production-ready LLM applications
- RAG systems with retrieval evaluation
- AI automation pipelines
- Scalable backend architectures for AI services

Each repository includes a clear README, system design notes, and practical implementation details.

---

## Collaboration

Open to:
- AI consulting
- Freelance / contract projects
- Long-term technical partnerships

I value **clear communication**, **transparent scope**, and **systems that can survive real-world use**.
